## What I found Interesting
Houda Chakiri, a professor at Al Akhawayn University, writes about how she prepares her students to enter the software engineering field that is currently being reshaped by generative AI. She encourages her students to use AI as a tool but not to rely too heavily on it and to always use it with caution. I think this is a realistic approach for using AI in a classroom because banning AI will not keep students from using it and AI can be a useful tool when used correctly. However, relying on AI too much is not so benficial when learning since it can also be very inaccurate. I like that she emphasizes that AI should complement your work rather than replace it. She also emphasizes the eithical and professional use of AI, making sure her students are aware that each industry may have different regulations regarding the use of AI and that understanding the regulations can prepare you to make better choices when using AI in your job.
